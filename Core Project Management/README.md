# Project Management Insights
## Project Goals
This project was undertaken to achieve the following objectives:

* Understand Employee Utilization: Provide insights into how employees allocate their time to billable and non-billable tasks.
* Analyze Time Spent Across Categories: Evaluate how time is distributed across various project categories and over months.
* Assess Project and Issue Status: Offer an overview of project statuses, issue resolution rates, and associated challenges.
By delivering actionable insights, this project aims to enhance decision-making processes and align resource utilization with organizational goals.

## Project Processes
1. Data Collection
The data was extracted from a project management platform and included the following CSV files:
* Users: Details of employees and their roles.
* Worklog: Time entries logged by employees.
* Issues: Details about project-related issues and their statuses.
* Accounts: Financial data related to project activities.
* Customers: Information about clients and their respective projects.
2. Data Preparation
* Cleaning:
Handled missing, inconsistent, and duplicate records.
Standardized formats for time and date fields.
* Transformation:
Created calculated fields, such as utilization rates and resolved/unresolved issue percentages.
Categorized projects based on type and status.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed key metrics, trends, and patterns in the dataset to identify actionable insights.
* Tools used for EDA: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
4. Dashboard Development
* Dashboards were developed to visualize key insights and facilitate data-driven decisions:
* Tools Used: Tableau and Python (dashboards integrated with interactive filters).
Dashboards Created:
* Project Overview: Status of projects and issues.
* Employee Utilization: Workload analysis and efficiency rates.
* Time Allocation by Category: Trends in time distribution across project categories and months.
5. Insight Reporting
Derived key findings from each dashboard, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.
Organized insights to address the project objectives and provided actionable recommendations.
